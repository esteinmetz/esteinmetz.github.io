A very handsome and well drawn man stands before you.  Before him, some smoky crater.  Behind, a door, obscured by all that damned blue smoke.  Specifically, a door unattached to a wall or any other support.  Just, standing up on it's own like a strong independent woman that don't need a man to live her best life.  The man is wearing sunglasses and a coat because he is both mysterious and cool.
Erik: My name is Erik, the door said.
Tim: SCREW YOU DOOR!
